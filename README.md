# Surf's Up

## Purpose
Our investors want the surf shop in Ohau to be open and profitable all year, not just seasonally. To reassure them that the surf shop will be just as relevant in the winter months as it is in the summer months, we are showing them that the weather is warm enough for surfing year round. If the temperature is warm, it's more likely that people will go out to enjoy the weather, and hopefully decide to give surfing a try!

## Summary
Overall, the temperatures in June and December aren't that different. We can make a solid argument that the temperatures are warm in Ohau year round. In June, it seems to be warmer for longer during the day. In December, the window for really warm temperatures is shorter. We can assume that in the morning and later in the evening, the temperature drops. So we do want to warn the investors that "busy hours" at the shop might change for the winter months. But the temperature will certainly be warm enough to surf.

## Results
- The average temperatures in June and December were approximately 75 degrees and 71 degrees, respectively.
- The minimum recorded temperature was 64 degrees in June, but only 56 degrees in Decemeber. 
- Both June and December have max temperatures recorded in the 80s (85 and 83 degrees, respecively).

## Additional Queries
In order to make a more informed decision on operating the surf shop in Ohau, we recommend investigating the following queries...
- What is the warmest time of day, on average, in the winter months? This can help inform our investors on operating hours.
- How much precipitation is there in June versus December? We would want to look at volume, as well as how many days a month precipitation is recorded.
